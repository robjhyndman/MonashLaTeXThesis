\section{First section}

Exponential smoothing was originally developed in the late
1950s \citep{Brown59,Brown63,Holt57,Winters60}. Empirical
studies by \citet[2000]{MH79} and \citet{Metal82} have found
little difference in forecast accuracy between exponential
smoothing and ARIMA models. This has made the family of
exponential smoothing procedures an attractive proposition
\citep[see][]{CKOS01}.
